# ST4gCNV

The ST4gCNV Steps to use Next-Generation Sequencing (short reads) data (>=10x) to assess gene copy number varations between (homoploid) populations and closely related species.

1. Megahit rapid assembly

2. Simulation of 10x reads based on genome assemblies

3. Mapping & read coverage depth estimation on genes

4. Gene CNV estimation based on simulated read coverages.
